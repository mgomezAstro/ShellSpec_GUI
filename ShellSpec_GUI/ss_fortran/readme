Dear new user,
here are some instructions how to install and run the code 
SHELLSPEC/ver.39 under Linux. It is distributed in one gzipped 
and tarred file: shellspec.tar.gz
A complete manual can be found in the file shellspec39.ps
(see mainly chapters: compilation, input, output).
This manual is an updated version of the original manual published 
along with some examples in:
Budaj, J., Richards, M. 2004, 
Contrib. Astron. Obs. Skalnate Pleso, 34, 167

-make the new directory e.g. shell
	mkdir shell

-copy the file into this directory
	cp shellspec.tar.gz shell/

-go into this directory
	cd shell

-unzip the file:
	gunzip shellspec.tar.gz

-untar the file:
	tar xvf shellspec.tar

(this will extract many files, the most important are:
shellspec39.f    -main fortran source code
param.inc39      -fortran include file with dimensation of arrays
pfdwor.inc       -fortran include file with partition functions
shellspec39.ps   -updated manual)

-compile the source code:
	sh compile

-run the example-test calculations with a few examples:
	sh shellspec.run

This will plot the output using gnuplot and compare it with 
the test output.

I would appreciate any your comments, suggestions, feedback or any 
bug/error reports. 

With my best wishes,
Jan Budaj
